= Introduction =

Brice Ambrosiak and I created this game for ESIAL's project.

Pixia is a new game where you will be able to developp a population, and make it growing until being the biggest one.
But there are many dangerous monsters whose want to destroy your work...


= Details =

 * This software is developped in C language and use the SDL library (graphics).

 * Nowadays, only a limited version is implemented. Indeed, because of the dead line, we had to review the project and make it easier. Nevertheless, we will go on working on it and we hope we will soon offer you a greater version.

 * It has a map editor.
